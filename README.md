# Backend Development Roadmap with .NET

## 1. Programming Fundamentals
- [x] **C# Language**:
  - Control structures (conditionals, loops).
  - Data types, variables, operators.
  - Functions, classes, and objects (OOP: Object-Oriented Programming).
  - Encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.
  - Delegates, events, LINQ.
- [x] **Data Structures and Algorithms**:
  - Arrays, lists, queues, stacks, dictionaries.
  - Search and sorting algorithms.
  - Time and space complexity (Big O).

## 2. .NET Framework and .NET Core
- **History and differences** between .NET Framework, .NET Core, and .NET 5+.
- **ASP.NET Core**: A modern platform for backend development.
  - Web application architecture.
  - MVC (Model-View-Controller) and Razor Pages patterns.
  - Routing and Middleware.
  - Dependency injection.

## 3. Databases
- **SQL and Relational Databases**:
  - SQL Server, MySQL, PostgreSQL.
  - Database design and normalization.
  - Relationships and keys (primary and foreign).
  - Queries, stored procedures, triggers.
- **Entity Framework Core**:
  - ORM (Object-Relational Mapping).
  - Code First vs Database First.
  - Migrations.
  - LINQ for advanced queries.

## 4. REST and SOAP APIs
- **REST APIs with ASP.NET Core**:
  - Creating controllers, routes, and endpoints.
  - HTTP verbs (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE).
  - JSON serialization with Newtonsoft or System.Text.Json.
- **Swagger/OpenAPI**: Automatic API documentation.
- **Authentication and Authorization**:
  - JWT (JSON Web Tokens).
  - OAuth2 and OpenID Connect.
- **SOAP APIs**:
  - Creating and consuming SOAP services with .NET.

## 5. Design Patterns and Architecture
- **SOLID Principles**: Best practices in software design.
- **Common Design Patterns**:
  - Repository, Unit of Work.
  - Singleton, Factory, Strategy.
- **Microservices**:
  - Separating applications into small, independent services.
  - Communication between microservices: HTTP, gRPC, RabbitMQ, Kafka.
  - Containerization with Docker.

## 6. Cloud Services and DevOps
- **Azure**:
  - Azure services: App Service, Azure Functions, Azure SQL.
  - Azure DevOps: CI/CD Pipelines.
  - Azure OpenAI and Cognitive Services for AI and Machine Learning.
- **Containers and Orchestration**:
  - Docker: Create and manage containers.
  - Kubernetes (Optional for container orchestration).

## 7. Version Control and Code Management
- **Git and GitHub**:
  - Cloning, committing, pushing/pulling.
  - Creating branches and merging.
  - Best practices with Git.
- **GitFlow**: An advanced branching strategy for managing projects.

## 8. Testing
- **Unit Testing**:
  - xUnit or NUnit.
  - Mocking frameworks: Moq.
  - Integration testing.
- **Test Driven Development (TDD)**: Development driven by testing.
- **CI/CD**: Continuous integration and continuous deployment.

## 9. Security
- **API Security**:
  - Encryption (TLS, HTTPS).
  - Authentication and Authorization: Roles and Claims.
  - Preventing common attacks: SQL Injection, XSS, CSRF.

## 10. Optimization and Scalability
- **Database Optimization**:
  - Indexing, partitioning, optimized queries.
- **Caching**:
  - Memcached, Redis.
- **Messaging**:
  - RabbitMQ or Azure Service Bus.
  - CQRS and Event-Driven Architecture.

## 11. Additional Skills
- **Agile Methodologies**: Scrum, Kanban.
- **Collaboration with other teams**:
  - Jira, Confluence, Slack.
- **Handling External APIs**:
  - Consuming third-party APIs.
  - Integrations with ERP or CRM systems (e.g., SAP CPI).

## 12. Personal and Freelance Projects
- **Build a strong portfolio**: Implement APIs, microservices, and open-source projects.
- **Contribute to open-source projects on GitHub.**
- **Work on freelance projects** to gain practical experience.
